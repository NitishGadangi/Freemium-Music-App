            So I recently found a vulnerability in Saavn Rest API which enables you to access premium content directly. 
So I decided why not make an app so that everyone can enjoy it.... and this app is the result.

***I will make the source code public [here](https://github.com/NitishGadangi/Freemium-App) once the App becomes Stable***

### Things to consider:
* The app is still in beta. So having bugs is common. If you found any bug, please report it here [Telegram Group](https://t.me/joinchat/HH4B2xFVtt6_2hbJl_qKQA).
* This App is developed Lollipop (API level 22) as the base, so it should work flawlessly on Marshmallow and above devices.
* However, ID3 tagging and Album art feature are currently enabled for only for devices with Android Oreo(Api 26) and Above.
* Downloads page is still under development and will be released in next beta...

### What about next release?
* Will include an online streaming feature within the app.
* Revamp the downloads page.
* Make the app Smoother
* Add option to select between mp3 and m4a
* Add a toggle to enable or disable Album art Feature.
